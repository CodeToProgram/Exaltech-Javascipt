        Survival of mankind without nature is impossible and humans need to
        understand that. If nature has the ability to protect us, it is also
        powerful enough to destroy the entire mankind. Every form of nature, for
        instance, the plants, animals, rivers, mountains, moon, and more holds
        equal significance for us.

        Nature is the natural, physical, material world or universe. “Nature”
        can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in
        general. It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the cosmic. Our planet
        is rich in nature. All natural things make nature more beautiful and
        attractive. It has flowing rivers, beautiful valleys, high mountains,
        singing birds, the oceans, the blue sky, different seasons, the rain,
        the beautiful moonlight etc. The beauty of nature is matchless. The
        blessings of nature on human beings are innumerable.

        The resources provided on the earth are limited. If we continue to
        deplete the resources at this pace, then they will soon exhaust.
        Urbanisation and development have resulted in excessive use of
        resources. For example, we are cutting trees to make houses, roads, and
        railway tracks. We are mining minerals and fossil fuels for
        transportation activities. We are extensively using water for
        agriculture and other activities. Our comfort has led to the destruction
        of nature. Deforestation, global warming, wildlife destruction,
        environmental pollution, ecosystem imbalance etc., are the consequences
        that threaten biodiversity and life on earth. To overcome them, we need
        to conserve our nature.
